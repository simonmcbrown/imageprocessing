Notes to try and remember where I have got to....

    - get_calib_from_scan.R
        takes the cropped q13 patch and measures the median of each of the 19 patches.  Seems to work.  Also reads the printed patches but does nothing yet.
        
    - apply_calib_to_png_devel3.R
        
    Have made notes that g18-con-20 does not have precision in the darks which makes it difficult to determine the correction eg scan_51_epMt_aRGB_g18_con-20.txt
